        The lion, scientifically known as Panthera leo, stands as one of the most
        iconic and majestic creatures in the animal kingdom. Renowned as the "king
        of the jungle," lions inhabit grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands
        across Africa and a small population in the Gir Forest National Park in
        India. <br> Known for their distinctive manes, which vary in color and length
        among individuals, male lions exude strength and dominance, while females
        play an integral role in the pride's social structure as skilled hunters
        and caretakers. Lions are highly social animals, forming family groups
        called prides that consist of related females, their cubs, and a coalition
        of males. These powerful predators are known for their impressive roars
        that can be heard from miles away, serving both as a means of
        communication and a declaration of territory.Despite their regal
        appearance, lions face various conservation challenges, including habitat
        loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching .
    <!-- <pre> Efforts to protect these
      magnificent creatures and their habitats are crucial for ensuring the
      survival of this iconic species.</pre> -->
