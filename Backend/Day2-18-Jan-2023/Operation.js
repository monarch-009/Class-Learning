// Objective: Basic operations in JavaScript

// Challenge 1 : Perform the addition operation (add x and y) and print the result in the console.
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let add = x + y;
console.log("Add: " + add);

// Challenge 2 : Perform the subtraction operation (subtract x and y) and print the result in the console.
let sub = x - y;
console.log("Subtract: " + sub);

// Challenge 3 : Perform the multiplication operation (multiply x and y) and print the result in the console.
let mul = x * y;
console.log("Multiply: " + mul);

// Challenge 4 : Perform the division operation (divide x and y) and print the result in the console.
let div = x / y;
console.log("Divide: " + div);

// Challenge 5 : Perform the remainder operation (x % y) and print the result in the console.
let rem = x % y;
console.log("Reminder: " + rem);

// Challenge 6 : Perform the exponential operation (x ** y) and print the result in the console.
let exp = x ** y;
console.log("Exponent: "+ exp);

// Challenge 7 : Calculate "x" to the power of "y" and print the result in the console.
let pow = Math.pow(x, y);
console.log("Power: " + pow);

// Challenge 8 : Decrement the value of "x" by 1 and print the result in the console.
x--;
console.log("Decrement: " + x);

// Challenge 9 : Perform Addition assignemnt operation to the variable a;
let a = 10;
a += 5;
console.log("Addition Assignment: " + a);

// Challenge 10 : Perform Subtraction assignemnt operation to the variable b;
let b = 10;
b -= 5;
console.log("Subtraction Assignment: " + b);

// Challenge 11 : Perform Multiplication assignemnt operation to the variable c;
let c = 10;
c *= 5;
console.log("Multiplication Assignment: " + c);

// Challenge 12 : Perform Division assignemnt operation to the variable d;
let d = 10;
d /= 5;
console.log("Division Assignment: " + d);

// Challenge 13 : Perfrom 2 Strict Equality operations and print the result in the console.
let e = 10;
let f = 10;
console.log("Strict Equality: " + (e === f));

// Challenge 14 : Perfrom 2 Strict non-equality operations and print the result in the console.
let g = 10;
let h = 10;
console.log("Strict Non-Equality: " + (g !== h));

// Challenge 15 : Perfrom 2 Equality operations and print the result in the console.
let i = 10;
let j = 10;
console.log("Equality: " + (i == j));

// Challenge 16 : Perfrom 2 non-equality operations and print the result in the console.
let k = 10;
let l = 10;
console.log("Non-Equality: " + (k != l));


// Challenge 17 : Perfrom 2 Less than or equal to operations in which one should return true and another should return false.
let m = 10;
let n = 20;
console.log("Less than or equal to: " + (m <= n));

// Challenge 18 : Perfrom 2 Greater than or equal to operations in which one should return true and another should return false.
let o = 10;
let p = 20;
console.log("Greater than or equal to: " + (o >= p));
